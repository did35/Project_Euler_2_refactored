Problem 2 refactored with high level functions filter() and reduce():<br />
The first commit was refactored base on the following article: https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swift-guide-to-map-filter-reduce/<br /><br />
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br /><br />
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
